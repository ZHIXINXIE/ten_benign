Maintain pressure for several minutes until the bleeding stops. If blood soaks through, add more cloth/gauze without removing the first layer. 3. **Clean the Wound:** Once bleeding is controlled, gently rinse the cut or scrape under cool running water to remove dirt and debris. Clean around the wound with mild soap and water, but try to avoid getting soap directly in the wound itself. You can use clean tweezers to carefully remove any embedded particles. 4. **Apply Ointment & Cover:** After cleaning, apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment (like Neosporin) or petroleum jelly to help keep the wound moist and prevent infection. Cover the wound with a sterile adhesive bandage (Band-Aid) or sterile gauze and tape. Make sure the dressing is clean and dry. 5. **Change Dressing & Monitor:** Change the bandage at least once a day, or sooner if it becomes wet or dirty.

Plant seeds or seedlings following the depth and spacing recommendations on the seed packet or plant tag. Don't overcrowd containers. 4. **Watering Consistently:** Container plants dry out faster than in-ground plants. Check soil moisture daily by sticking your finger an inch or two deep; water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry until water drains from the bottom. 5. **Fertilizing & Care:** Most potting mixes contain limited nutrients, so plan to fertilize periodically with a diluted liquid fertilizer according to product instructions. Monitor plants for pests and diseases and address issues promptly; provide stakes, cages, or trellises for vining or taller plants."}]}
